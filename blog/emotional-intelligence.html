        * What is Emotional Intelligence?
        <br><br>
        Emotional Intelligence (EI or EQ) is the ability to recognise, understand, and manage one's own emotions, as well as the emotions of others. It encompasses a range of skills and abilities, including self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.
        <br><br><br>
        * How is EQ different to IQ?
        <br><br>
        EQ is different from IQ in several ways. While IQ measures cognitive intelligence, EQ measures emotional intelligence. IQ is focused on analytical and logical thinking, while EQ is focused on understanding and managing emotions. IQ is largely fixed and determined by genetics, while EQ can be learned and developed over time through practice and experience.
        <br><br><br>
        * Why is EQ important?
        <br><br>
        EQ is important for several reasons. First, it helps individuals to better understand and manage their own emotions, leading to greater self-awareness and self-regulation. This can help individuals to manage stress, make better decisions, and maintain healthy relationships. Second, EQ is crucial in social and professional settings, as it helps individuals to understand and navigate the emotions and behaviours of others. This can lead to better communication, collaboration, and leadership skills. 
        <br><br>
        Finally, EQ has a range of positive outcomes, including higher performance, better physical and mental health, and greater life satisfaction.
