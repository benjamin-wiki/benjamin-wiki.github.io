    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h5>13 April 2023</h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      1. Blocked on a simple problem</b>
      <br><br>
      I was struggling to implement a function that would allow me to filter an array of objects based on a specific property value.
      I tried using for loops and if statements, but my solution became increasingly convoluted and difficult to read. Frustration grew as multiple attempts failed to produce a clean and efficient solution.
      Lessons Learned: Eventually, I discovered the JavaScript array method filter(), which allowed me to easily achieve the desired result in a more concise and readable manner. I learned the importance of researching and exploring new techniques when faced with roadblocks in coding.
      <br><br><br>
      <b>2. Elegantly solved a problem</b> 
      <br><br>
      I needed to create a function that would take a list of numbers and return the sum of all even numbers.
      I opted for an approach, using the filter() and reduce() array methods, that I had just learnt about.
      As I worked through the solution, I felt a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction with the the code.
      Lessons Learned: The experience taught me the value of exploring different methods and approaches to solving problems.
      <br><br><br>
      <b>3. Confidence in problem-solving techniques</b>
      <br><br>
      Pseudocode: Confident <br>
      Trying something: Moderate <br>
      Rubber ducky method: Confident <br>
      Reading error messages: Confident <br>
      Console.logging: Moderate <br>
      Googling: Very confident <br>
      Asking others for help: Confident <br>
      Improving my processes with reflection: Confident
      <br><br><br>
      <b>4. Reluctance to ask for help</b>
      <br><br>
      I dont usually feel reluctant to ask someone for help. I've learnt that you actually look a fool when you pretend to know something. Most of the time people want enjoy helping others, it makes them feel good which makes me feel good! And I enjoy asking for help because I like to learn! :D
      <br><br><br>
      Problem-solving can be both challenging and rewarding. Learning to embrace various techniques, including asking for help, is crucial for success. As I continue to develop my skills, I will strive to maintain an open mind, learn from my experiences, and reflect on my problem-solving approaches to become a more effective and confident programmer.
