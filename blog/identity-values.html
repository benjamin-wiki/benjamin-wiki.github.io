      <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
      <h5>31 March 2023</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. 
        <br><br>
        > I encountered an ethical dilemma at the beach when an old man frightened a young kid learning to surf. The man was yelling and physically shaking him off his board, visibly upsetting the child to tears. Balancing the values of respect for elders and empathy for the vulnerable, I chose to intervene by calmly approaching the old man and explaining the child's situation as a beginner. My decision allowed the child to feel safe and continue learning, and while the old man did not seem to understand the importance of patience and encouragement, Iâ€™m proud of my ability to uphold compassion and empathy while resolving the conflict respectfully.
        <br><br><br>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.
        <br><br>
        > Growing up in a house that emphasises strong work ethic and compassion, I've been deeply influenced by the values instilled in me by my family. Their consistent reinforcement of these ideals has shaped part of my identity, encouraging me to strive for success while remaining empathetic and supportive towards others.
        <br><br><br>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
        <br><br>
        > My strengths in adaptability, perseverance, and critical thinking will empower me to overcome challenges, embrace new perspectives, and continuously grow throughout my learning journey.
        <br><br><br>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        <br><br>
        > Recognising my limitations of procrastination and susceptibility to boredom, I can actively develop strategies to overcome these challenges, ensuring a more effective and engaging learning journey.
        <br><br><br>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?
        <br><br>
        > During a group project, I encountered resistance and tension from a group member who was hesitant to share their ideas and engage in discussions. At the time, I attempted to create a supportive environment by openly encouraging their input and actively seeking their opinions, which gradually improved collaboration. Reflecting on this experience, I would now also consider discussing individual strengths and assigning tasks accordingly, to further alleviate tension and optimise team dynamics by leveraging everyones unique skills.
