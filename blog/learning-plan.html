        What is your long term goal or career pathway
        <br><br>
        > Create my own apps, work remotely as a software developer/engineer, maybe go on to learn more at university?
        <br><br><br>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
        <br><br>
        > I learn the best when I am actually making something and when I need help/advice to go out and search for it through tutorials. Learning this way overtime seems to stack pretty well in my memory. Frequent breaks to do something I enjoy such as surfing / skating keeps me motivated to learn and vice versa. 
        <br><br><br>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 
        <br><br>
        > Verbal communication and articulation, work through the anxiety of speaking out loud, improve my tone, inflections and body language
        <br><br><br>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme
        <br><br>
        > Stick to a time schedule and remembering to decompress in my break / downtime 
        <br>
        > Communicating openly and honestly with peers
        <br><br><br>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        <br><br>
        > Google and YouTube for online resources and asking fellow dev academy students and facilitators 
        <br><br><br>
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team 
        <br><br>
        > Honest feedback including areas to improve :)
        <br><br><br>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
