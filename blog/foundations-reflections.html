      <h1>Foundation Reflections</h1>
      <h5>29 April 2023</h3>
      <p class="blog-post">
        <b>What are three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning?</b>
        <br><br>
        * I found out that I truly enjoy reaching a flow state during coding sessions, which keeps me engaged and focused.
        <br>
        * I realised that I struggle with fully listening and absorbing information, so I need to work on improving my listening skills.
        <br>
        * I discovered that I find satisfaction in refactoring and formatting code, making it more readable and easier to understand.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
        <br><br>
        * Values guide my actions and decisions, shaping my learning journey and the way I approach programming challenges.
        <br>
        * Empathy allows me to connect with others, understand different perspectives, and collaborate effectively, which is crucial in programming teams.
        <br>
        * Self-awareness helps me recognise my strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, enabling me to tailor my approach to learning and programming for better results.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</b>
        <br><br>
        I was most surprised by the strong emphasis on personal growth and well-being in addition to technical programming skills. I also found the focus on collaboration and pair programming to be enjoyable and beneficial for understanding different problem-solving approaches.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b>
        <br><br>
        I found it challenging to maintain focus, deal with feelings of being overwhelmed by new information, and work with a self-critical mindset. Additionally, starting exercises was difficult for me, and managing my well-being throughout the learning process was a challenge.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>Why do I think a programming school is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
        <br><br>
        The focus on core learning in a web development Bootcamp helps students like me develop a strong foundation in personal growth, empathy, and self-awareness, which are essential for success in the programming world. These skills not only improve learning outcomes but also foster better collaboration and problem-solving in professional environments.
        <br><br><br>

        <b>Does the time I spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practice programming instead?</b>
        <br><br>
        No, the time spent on core learning doesn't feel like a waste of time. While practicing programming is essential, developing a strong foundation in personal growth, mindfulness, and self-awareness enhances my overall learning experience and long-term success. By balancing technical skills with personal growth, I'm better prepared to tackle programming challenges and collaborate effectively with others in my future career.
        <br><br><br>
        
        With the insights gained from my reflections, I now have a better understanding of my strengths, areas for improvement, and the importance of personal growth in my programming journey. This will help me continue to develop both as a programmer and an individual.
