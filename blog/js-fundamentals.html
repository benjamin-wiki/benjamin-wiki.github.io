    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <h5>13 April 2023</h3>
    <p class="blog-post">
      Let's break down JavaScript fundamentals in a simple, non-technical way!
      <br><br>
      An analogy to describe JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
      Imagine building a house. HTML is like the blueprint that defines the structure of the house (walls, doors, windows, etc.). CSS is like the interior design, which determines the colours, styles, and layout of the furniture. JavaScript is like the electricity, powering the appliances, lights, and other interactive elements in the house.
      In web development, HTML provides the structure of a webpage, CSS styles it, and JavaScript makes it interactive and dynamic.
      <br><br><br>
      * Control flow and loops in everyday life
      <br><br>
      Control flow is how we make decisions and repeat actions in a specific order. Let's take cooking a meal as an example. To cook a meal, you follow a series of steps:
      1. Check the recipe (conditional statement).
      2. If you have all the ingredients, start cooking (loop through each step in the recipe).
      3. If you don't have the ingredients, go shopping for them (another loop).
      <br><br>
      In this example, the control flow determines the order of the steps and how they're executed based on conditions (having ingredients) and loops (shopping/cooking steps).
      <br><br><br>
      * What is the DOM and how do you interact with it?
      <br><br>
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a tree-like representation of a webpage's structure. It allows you to interact with and manipulate the elements on a webpage using JavaScript.
      <br>
      For example, suppose you want to change the background colour of a webpage when a button is clicked. You can use JavaScript to access the DOM, find the button element, and add an event listener that changes the background colour when the button is clicked.
      <br><br><br>
      * Accessing data from arrays and objects
      <br><br>
      In JavaScript, arrays and objects are two common ways to store and organise data.
      <br>
      Arrays are like a list of items, where each item has a numerical index (0, 1, 2, etc.). For example:
      <br>
      <code>
      const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
      </code>
      <br><br>
      To access data from an array, you use the index:
      <br>
      <code>
      console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: apple
      </code>
      <br><br>
      Objects, on the other hand, store data as key-value pairs:
      <br>
      <code>
      const fruitColors = {
        apple: 'red',
        banana: 'yellow',
        orange: 'orange'
      };
      </code>
      <br><br>
      To access data from an object, you use the key:
      <br>
      <code>
      console.log(fruitColors.apple); // Output: red
      </code>
      <br><br><br>
      * Functions and their usefulness
      <br><br>
      Functions are like reusable pieces of code that perform a specific task. They help you avoid repeating code and make your code more organised and easier to maintain.
      <br><br>
      For example, let's say you want to calculate the area of multiple rectangles. Instead of writing the same calculation repeatedly, you can create a function that does the calculation for you:
      <br><br>
      <code>
      function calculateArea(width, height) { <br>
        return width * height; <br>
      }
      <br>
      <br>
      const area1 = calculateArea(10, 20);
      <br>
      const area2 = calculateArea(5, 10);
      <br>
      <br>
      console.log(area1); // Output: 200
      <br>
      console.log(area2); // Output: 50
      </code>
      <br><br>
      In this example, the calculateArea function takes width and height as parameters and returns the area of the rectangle. By using the function, you can easily calculate the area for different rectangles without repeating the calculation code.
